# Fake News Detection
### Overview
In this project, it is intended to use the sentence embedding technique in addition to word embedding for the purpose of fake new classification. The Classifier (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) will be trained and tested for identifying the fake news data.

#### Test Data Split
Collected data are split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80%:20%.

|               |   X   |   Y   |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Training      | 2800  | 2800  |
| Testing       | 700  | 700  |
| Total         | 3500  | 3500  |

### How to Run
